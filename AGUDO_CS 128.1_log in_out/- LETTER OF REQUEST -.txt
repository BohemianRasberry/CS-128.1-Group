Good Day po, Ma'am.

I am writing this letter as to request that the work I would be sending would get
no demerits for being late. I'm a very slow learner po and nanghihingi lang po
sana ng consideration po. I also had some other functions in there po and designed
it a bit din po. That is all po.

Thank you po in advance and God Bless po!
